# Computation-Theory-Lambda-Transpiler
An implementation of a transpiler for the lambda pseudo-language. Performs syntax and lexical analysis on an input code file and "translates" it to C source code. Created according to assignment specifications for the year 2024 within the course "Computation Theory".

# Requirements
For the creation of the lexical analyser the package flex was used. For the syntax analyser I used the bison package.
